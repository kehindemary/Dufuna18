My name is Mary Abiodun, a proud Nigerian and a lady with a difference.
I'm a student of Mathematics and Education at the University of Lagos.
I love tech and I believe that with tech, we can solve most of the world's problems.
One fun fact about me is that I'm small but mighty.

I love collaborating and working with guys. They sure have a lot to teach girls.
