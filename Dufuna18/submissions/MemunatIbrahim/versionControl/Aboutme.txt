I am Ibrahim Memunat, a computer science graduate and a software developer.
I loved logical, computational thinking, and enjoy solving problem.
I heard of the dufuna-fem program in a chat room, thought it would be fun, and decided to apply.
Honestly, the journey so far has been amazing, and I am enthusiastic for the future weeks ahead.
I almost forgot, I am a female :)
